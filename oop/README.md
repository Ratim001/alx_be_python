# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📖 **Overview**  
This directory explores the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python through practical demonstrations. It includes examples related to classes, objects, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These concepts are essential for understanding object-oriented system design and software development.

🛠 **Features**  
- **Book Class**:
  - Demonstrates constructor methods (`__init__`, etc.) and object representation (`__str__`, `__repr__`).
- **Class and Static Methods**:
  - Explains the usage of `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators for flexible function calls.
- **Library System**:
  - Implements inheritance to manage various types of books (e.g., `EBook`, `PrintBook`) in a library.
- **Polymorphism Demo**:
  - Showcases polymorphic behavior by calculating areas of different shapes using shared method names.

📂 **Files in the Directory**  
- **`book_class.py`**:
   - Demonstrates the implementation of a Book class using Python's special methods for object creation and representation.
- **`class_static_methods_demo.py`**:
   - Explains the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods.
- **`library_system.py`**:
   - Implements a basic library system using inheritance, including specialized classes for eBooks and printed materials.
- **`polymorphism_demo.py`**:
   - Demonstrates polymorphism by creating a Shape class and its subclasses like Rectangle and Circle.
